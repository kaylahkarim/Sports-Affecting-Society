<B>Sports Affecting Society</B> is a study meant to prove or disprove the fact of weather sports affects society, and if sports do affect society, is it in a positive way, or a negative way. The reason I am collecting this data is not just out of curiosity. I will be entering my findings into the 2016 Pioneer High School Science Fair. 

<P>

So, to make collecting this data easier and more comfortable for the moth of us, I have designed an online survey (or series of surveys) to collect this data.

<P>

<B>If you are interested in participating in this experiment please read the following:</B><BR>

<UL><I>Full Survey</I>- The full survey contains questions regarding the following:

<LI>Collage/Life

<LI>Health and Foods

<LI>Mental Health

<LI>Drug Use

<LI>Sexual Activity

<LI>Abuse

<LI>Sexual Assault 

<LI>Sexual Orientation and Ethnicity

</UL>

<P>

<B>If you are uncomfortable with any of these categories please continue to read:</B> <BR>

<I>Series surveys</I>- The series surveys contain the same beginning questions in each category, the same categories above apply to the series surveys except they have been split into sections for your convenience and comfortably. We ask that if you do choose to participate in one of the series surveys, you only participate in one. Patriating in more than one survey could alter the concluding results of this study.

<P>

<B>It is crucial to this study that the concluding data be accurate.

If at a certain point in the survey you are too uncomfortable to answer a question honestly, please exit the survey.

Honesty is the most important part of this study.<P>

ALL STUDY RESULTS WILL BE ANNONYMOUS  . (I can not stress this enough.)
